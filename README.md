# livefree
Designed and created a high fidelity prototype for livefree, a mobile app meant to help students find events offering free food/items around campus. I first did some customer discovery and created personas, and then moved on to creating low fidelity prototypes. I then created high fidelity prototypes, and did some user testing.
